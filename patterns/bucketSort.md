### ELI5
- Create buckets
- Distribute elements into buckets
- Sort each bucket
- Concatenate buckets

### Complexity
- Time O(n + k)
- Space O(n + k)
k is the number of buckets

### Applications
- Effective when input is distributed over a short range

### Misc
- Stable sorting algorithm (maintains the relative order of equal elements)
- Works well with floats or evenly distributed numbers

### Examples
