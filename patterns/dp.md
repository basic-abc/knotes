### ELI5
- Find base case
- Find relationship between n & n-1

### Applications
- Always draw the decision tree for visualization
- Identify overlapping sub problems

### Tips
- The returned value should always reflect the subproblem's goal

### Top-down vs Bottom-up
- Bottom-up DP must solve subproblems in a specific order and is not as flexible as top-down
- Bottom-up usually needs to solve every subproblem, which may be more subproblems than that of top-down DP
- Bottom-up iterative is faster than top-down recursive call stack
