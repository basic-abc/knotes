### Fucking bane of my existence
- LIFO

### Applications
- "Store first, deal with it (near) later after some event" - Polish notation, valid parentheses
- "Next" greater / lesser, "Previous" greater / lesser, these hint at the recency property that comes with using a stack, or aims to save redundant work over the brute force method

### Examples

- [1063. Number of Valid Subarrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-valid-subarrays/description/)
