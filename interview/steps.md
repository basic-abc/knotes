### Steps to practice in each & every question
1. Establishing requirement
- Understand the problem completely
- Ask clarifying questions
- Discuss brute force approach
  - Analyze time & space complexity
- Identify constraints & edge cases

2. Solution design
- Propose optimizations and alternatives
- Verbalize thought process

3. Implementation
- Write clean, readable, structured code
- Explain while coding

4. Rework
- (When stuck, steps to review your work)
  - Is it wrong?
    - What observation or pattern are you missing?
  - Is it inefficient?
    - Consider different data structures?
- Ask questions when stuck
- Incorporate feedback immediately

5. Definition of done
- Write test cases
- Review code

6. Documentation
- Discuss trade-offs & limitations
  - Analyze time & space complexity
- Be positive & open to suggestions
